# NASA Images

In this project my task was to create a React front end app that presents the data from the free [NASA astronomy image of the day API](https://api.nasa.gov/).
I have also started to experiment with Docker. If you have Docker installed you can simply run (on Windows platform) the docker-run.bat and you can access the website at http://localhost:4000.

Every day there's a new image or video uploaded by NASA. You can also read a brief description below the image/video. On the landing page you'll see the current one, but you can simply choose any date from the past and the site will update itself.

I have learned and furthered my knowledge in the following topics:

- Create a React app
- UseEffect and UseState in React
- Docker deployment
